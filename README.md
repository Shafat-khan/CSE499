To develop a robust cross-architectural knowledge distillation framework that enhances computational efficiency and accuracy for 3D medical imaging object detection by leveraging:
A hybrid teacher model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (VGG19) and Vision Transformers (ViT) for complementary feature extraction.
Knowledge distillation to train an EfficientNet-based student model for optimized deployment.
Integration of Multi-Scale Geometric Feature Fusion (MSGFF) to effectively process diverse scales in point cloud data.
